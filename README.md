# Fourier_Transform_On_Boundaries
It is a classical method to shape recognition and a general method to encode various shape signatures. I have used Fourier descriptors to recognize different binary aeroplane identification. Currently, in artificial intelligence systems, the segmentation and classification of objects on images are widely used Fourier descriptors
